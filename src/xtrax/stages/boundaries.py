"""Per-axis boundary operations for composable pipeline stages.

Three distinct boundary op types — keep them separate:
  Fuse[S, O]  — pure axis reducer: stacked S -> single O. Stays in pipeline.
  Tap[T]      — identity + side effect: T -> T. Stays in pipeline.
  Sink[T]     — terminal side effect: T -> None. Leaves pipeline.

The Fuse/Tap/Sink distinction is the property the type checker enforces:
whether the value continues downstream or leaves the pipeline entirely.

AxisBoundary bundles optional fuse, tap, and sink for one named axis.
All fields are eqx.field(static=True) — no JAX arrays; all are callables.

Note: Fuse is distinct from FuseFn in xtrax.stages.protocols. Fuse is for
axis-level reduction after stacking; FuseFn is a more generic reduction protocol.
