"""CarryShape — metadata for wave-axis carry without binding to traced values.

CarryShape is a lightweight descriptor for carry-bearing scans that holds only
shape and dtype information. Unlike CarrySpec (which holds an actual init value
that may contain traced JAX arrays), CarryShape defers materialization to the
mode class's __call__ method.

Used by AutoregressiveDecode and other mode classes that need to declare
carry metadata at class construction time without binding to a specific JAX
trace context.

Risk D-10 mitigation: Introduces a separate metadata struct, leaving CarrySpec
unchanged for planner Phase-0 consumption.
