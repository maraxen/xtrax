"""CarrySpec — declare a carry-bearing scan on a named axis.

Used by SamplingSpecification (and custom experiment specs) to indicate which
axes should use jax.lax.scan with a carry, rather than safe_map (stateless).
BatchPlanner.plan() reads CarrySpec list in Phase 0 and pre-demotes matching
axes to Scan(init, transition) decisions before Phases 1 and 2.

CONSTRAINT: Heterogeneous axes (shapes vary per element) cannot be scanned —
jax.lax.scan requires static carry shape. CarrySpec rejects known heterogeneous
axis names eagerly; the planner validator enforces this at runtime.
