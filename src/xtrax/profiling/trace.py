"""Pure trace parsing: named_scope wall-clock attribution + dispatch counts.

No first-party imports (no ``prolix``, no sibling ``xtrax`` submodules), no
relative imports -- AST-enforced in tests/profiling/test_claim_contract.py.
Upstreamed from prolix ``scripts/profiling/trace.py`` (branch
wt-20260807-132628) on 2026-08-24; see
.praxia/docs/specs/260824_upstream-profiling-probe-tooling-from-prolix.md and
prolix's 260817_jax-profiling-optimization-workflow.md section P4 for the
full design rationale.

**How named_scope labels actually surface (resolved empirically BEFORE
writing this parser, per P4's own requirement to resolve this before, not
after):** neither as a nested Perfetto duration slice, nor as a
TraceAnnotation/XLA-Modules row. On the JAX CPU backend where this was
resolved, the EXECUTED trace's per-thunk events are named after their
(post-fusion) HLO op/thunk name (e.g. "wrapped_multiply",
"reduce_add_fusion" -- carried in each event's ``args["hlo_op"]``), which by
itself names no named_scope at all. The named_scope path survives instead as
a ``/``-delimited prefix on the separately-obtained COMPILED HLO text's
per-instruction ``op_name`` metadata (e.g.
``metadata={op_name="jit(f)/outer_scope/inner_a/..."}``, confirmed via
``jax.jit(fn).lower(*args).compile().as_text()``). Attribution is therefore
two-input, not trace-only: the executed trace supplies exclusive
durations/occurrence counts per thunk name; the compiled HLO text supplies
the thunk-name -> scope-path mapping (``scope_map_from_hlo_text`` below).
Per spec P4's own fallback clause ("if labels surface as flat name prefixes
instead, state that exclusive time is computed by prefix-depth attribution
instead"): each entry-computation instruction's time is attributed to the
DEEPEST known scope label appearing in its op_name path, resolved by
following ``calls=``/``to_apply=`` references down through nested
computations when the top-level instruction itself carries no metadata of
its own. A resolved label is therefore always exactly one string per
instruction -- there is no mixed-scope ambiguity to arbitrate under this
rule.

**JAX-version fragility**: the event names matched here (e.g.
"CommonPjRtLoadedExecutable::ExecuteHelperOnSingleDevice") were resolved
empirically against one JAX install (prolix pinned jax 0.10.2) and are NOT
contract-stable across JAX upgrades. Re-spike presence-not-spelling before
trusting dispatch counts from a newer JAX.
