"""Claim-validity contract: what a ProbeRecord may be cited to support.

No first-party imports (no ``prolix``, no sibling ``xtrax`` submodules) and no
relative imports -- grep/AST-enforced in tests/profiling/test_claim_contract.py.
This package was upstreamed from prolix ``scripts/profiling`` (branch
wt-20260807-132628) on 2026-08-24; see
.praxia/docs/specs/260824_upstream-profiling-probe-tooling-from-prolix.md and,
for the original design rationale, prolix's
.praxia/docs/specs/260817_jax-profiling-optimization-workflow.md section P1
(why the guards below are the specific ones that exist: the roofline argument
for TERM_RANKING's stage>=2 floor, the memory-regime argument for
SCALE_EXTRAPOLATION_LIMIT, and the 1170x XLA_FLAGS finding on prolix's
Blackwell nodes for the unanimity checks).

Keeping this package free of xtrax imports preserves its portability in both
directions: it can move back upstream (or onward to a third consumer) as a
move, not a rewrite.

# repeated block_until_ready() calls on an already-computed result produce
